# Checkers-game - a highschool project worked on with DarkHawk727.

This is a project for highschool that I worked on with DarkHawk727, a classmate and close friend. 

Double jumps don't work and some aspects of the code seem buggy, but an effort was made.

  I learned a lot from this code and got a better understanding of two dimensional arrays, if statements, and classes.
  
  Truth be told, I'm not very adept and coding. I have some experience with C++ and a little with java too, but this project took about a week or two with DarkHawk727 to complete, and even then it's not perfect and still has some issues. The main problem we had was that we were confusing the columns and rows with each other and wondered for hours what was wrong. ㅠ.ㅠ
  
  We managed to push pass it though, and this was our end result. Nothing remarkable, but a great start, at least in my eyes.
